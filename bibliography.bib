abstract = {A semantic interpretation A for a programming language L is fully abstract if, whenever A〚C[M]〛⊑A〚C[N]〛 for two program phrases M,N and for all program contexts C[ ], it follows that A〚M〛⊑A〚N〛. A model M for the language is fully abstract if the natural interpretation A of L in M is fully abstract. We show that under certain conditions there exists, for an extended typed λ-calculus, a unique fully abstract model.}

abstract="SPCF is an idealized sequential programming language, based on Plotkin's language PCF, that permits programmers and programs to observe the evaluation order of procedures. In this paper, we construct a fully abstract model of SPCF using a new mathematical framework suitable for defining fully abstract models of sequential functional languages. Then, we develop an extended typed $\lambda$-calculus to specify the operational semantics of SPCF and show that the calculus is complete for the constant-free sub-language. Finally, we prove that SPCF is computationally complete: it can express all the computable (recursively enumerable) elements in its fully abstract model.",
